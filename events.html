            <li style="color: yellow;"class="event1">Creator Awards</li>
            <p class="eventsP">
                The smaller creators deserve to be recognized too. This is my biggest (and most expensive project) 
                so if you or any other communities you are a part of under 20k followers this is your invite. 
                We will premier top clips, fan art, and even fully custom and dedicated music for this event.
            </p>

                A massive event where multiple communities come together to showcase their favorite up-and-coming streamers. 
                Over the course of a few hours, we review best clips, funniest moments, most hype chat interactions, and overall 
                stream energy to determine who has the most potential to be the next big thing (Other superlatives will be included as 
                well)

            <p class="eventsP">
                A high-stakes 1v1 tournament where participants don't know what games they'll compete in ahead of time. 
                The games will be revealed right before the matches, ensuring no one can train unfairly.

                complete on-stream challenges, and entertain their chat to win points.

                The Last Streamer Standing (Endurance & Skill Event) - A streaming endurance event where contestants compete in 
                rounds of grueling, chaotic, or unpredictable challenges, and one by one, they get eliminated. The last streamer

                Streamer Edition (Trivia + Gameshow Hybrid) - A live-streamed gameshow where streamers compete in Twitch, 
                gaming, and pop culture trivia while also facing on-the-spot challenges (e.g., “do an impression,” “speedrun a

            <p class="eventsP">
                A speedrun event where the goal is NOT to finish fast, but to fail in the most creative way possible. 
                Players are given random objectives like “Die in the most dramatic way,” “Softlock your game,” or 
                “Find the dumbest glitch” before time runs out.
            </p>

            <li style="color: rgb(155, 20, 20);">Streamer Roast Night</li>
            <p class="eventsP">
                A brutal, hilarious, no-holds-barred roast session where streamers take turns absolutely flaming each 
                other—all in good fun. Whether you're here to dish out savage one-liners or just survive the heat, 
                this is the ultimate comedy showdown where only the funniest (or thickest-skinned) will make it out unscathed!
