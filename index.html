        <h3 class="centerTxt" id="what">What are the Creator Awards?</h3>

        <p class="centerTxt"> We believe small creators deserve to be seen just as much OR EVEN MORE 
            than big full time creators. Artists deserve to be recognized, small creators deserve to be recognized, and 
            programmers deserve to be recognized. Without these people the streaming and content world would be bland and basic. 
            Small creators who go to work every day, go to school full time, and have other obligations are the hardest working 
            people on the planet. They have passions that push them to work on what they love even when they have little to no 
            time whatsoever! <br> <strong>You deserve recognition</strong>.</p>

            <br>

        <h3 class="centerTxt" id="keeg">The Creator - Keeg</h3>

        <p class="centerTxt" id="creator"> I'm Keegan / Keeg! At heart I am a creator coach, event planner, and networker for 
            smaller creators. I have always thought about how the big creators worked so hard to get where they are but it leaves 
            little to no room for the little guy to be recognized. This is why I created the Creator Awards. Not only will small 
            creators be able to shine at the end of the year showcasing their best moments, personalities, and creativity, but they 
            will be able to participate in events throughout the year to hedge their bets on becoming more known. It's an ambitious 
            project with rapidly growing numbers and the goal is to help these types of people do what they love, doing content full 
            time. With the help of <strong>YOU</strong>, we can make peoples dreams, reality. We can give them that push, that spark, the feeling of 
            what it means to be a full time content creator.</p>
